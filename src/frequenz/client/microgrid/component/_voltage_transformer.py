    Voltage transformers are used to step up or step down the voltage, keeping
    the power somewhat constant by increasing or decreasing the current.

    If voltage is stepped up, current is stepped down, and vice versa.

    Note:
        Voltage transformers have efficiency losses, so the output power is always less
        than the input power.
