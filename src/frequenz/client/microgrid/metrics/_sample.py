        Suppose a metric sample for active power has a lower-bound of -10,000 W, and an
        upper-bound of 10,000 W. For the system to accept a charge command, clients need

    """The bounds that apply to the metric sample.

    These bounds adapt in real-time to reflect the operating conditions at the time of
    aggregation or derivation.

    In the case of certain components like batteries, multiple bounds might exist. These
    multiple bounds collectively extend the range of allowable values, effectively
    forming a union of all given bounds. In such cases, the value of the metric must be
    within at least one of the bounds.

    In accordance with the passive sign convention, bounds that limit discharge would
    have negative numbers, while those limiting charge, such as for the State of Power
    (SoP) metric, would be positive. Hence bounds can have positive and negative values
    depending on the metric they represent.

    Example:
        The diagram below illustrates the relationship between the bounds.

        ```
             bound[0].lower                         bound[1].upper
        <-------|============|------------------|============|--------->
                     bound[0].upper      bound[1].lower

        ---- values here are disallowed and will be rejected

    This will be present when the same `Metric` can be obtained from multiple
    electrical connections within the component. Knowing the connection can help in
    certain control and monitoring applications.

    In cases where the component has just one connection for a metric, then the
    connection is `None`.

    Example:
        A hybrid inverter can have a DC string for a battery and another DC string for a
        PV array. The connection names could resemble, say, `dc_battery_0` and
        ``dc_pv_0`. A metric like DC voltage can be obtained from both connections. For
        an application to determine the SoC of the battery using the battery voltage,
        which connection the voltage metric was sampled from is important.
